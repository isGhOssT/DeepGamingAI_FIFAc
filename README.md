sorry this gif is awful
## Features
* Easy to use and clean syntax
* Automatic events handling
* Supports custom fields and styles without adding any weird syntax (just create a react component)
* Applies by default the current OS style

## Installation
```
    npm install --save react-native-form-generator
```
## Warning: I'm actively working on this project
### ...so
* Pull requests are very very welcome
* All the elements are tested and stable against normal use cases (but i expect to do a lot of changes here and there)
* Validation is coming with maximum priority
* Slider hasn't been created
* I have to document the code properly and do some housekeeping, i apologize in advance.
* Android support is coming.

* This project requires (for some fields) react-native-vector-icons to show icons in some fields (i will remove this dependency soon)

## Example
the example below generates the form you see in the animation
```javascript

import { Form, InputField,
        Separator, SwitchField, LinkField ,
        PickerField, DatePickerField
      } from 'react-native-form-generator';

 export class MyCoolComponent extends React.Component{
  handleFormChange(formData){
    /*
    formData will contain all the values of the form,
    in this example.

    formData = {
      first_name:"",
      last_name:"",
      gender: '',
      birthday: Date,
      has_accepted_conditions: bool
    }
     */

   }
   render(){
      <Form
        ref='registrationForm'
        onFocus={this.handleFormFocus.bind(this)}
        onChange={this.handleFormChange.bind(this)}
        name="Personal Information">
        <InputField ref='first_name' label='First Name' placeholder='First Name'/>
        <InputField ref='last_name' placeholder='Last Name'/>
        <PickerField ref='gender' placeholder='Gender'
          options={{
            male: 'Male',
            female: 'Female'
          }}/>
        <DatePickerField ref='birthday'
          minimumDate={new Date('1/1/1900')}
          maximumDate={new Date()} mode='date' placeholder='Birthday'/>
        <Separator text='Terms & Conditions'/>
        <LinkField text='Read terms & conditions'     onPress={this.openTermsAndConditionsURL.bind(this)}/>
        <SwitchField text='I accept Terms & Conditions' ref="has_accepted_conditions"
          helpText='Please read carefully the terms & conditions'/>
      </Form>);
  }
}
```
